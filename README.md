# 📚 Book Search App (React + Google Books API)

This is a simple but powerful **book search web app** built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and the **Google Books API**.

I started this project while learning React fundamentals and gradually upgraded it from **dummy data** to a **real API-based application**. The main goal was to understand how real-world data flows through a React app.

## ✨ What this app does

- 🔍 Search for books in real time
- 📖 Fetches real book data from Google Books API
- 🖼️ Displays book cover, title, author, and rating
- ⚡ Instant filtering while typing
- 📱 Responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
- ❌ Shows a friendly message when no books are found

## 🧠 Why I built this

I wanted to:
- Practice **React state management**
- Learn how to **fetch and transform API data**
- Understand **props, lifting state, and component communication**
- Build something that feels like a **real hackathon project**

This project helped me connect the dots between:
> input → state → API → UI → user experience
